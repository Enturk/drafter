Drafter Quick Start Guide
--------------------------
Drafter is an educational interactive graphics Python library. What does that mean?

As a student, you can use Drafter to learn and practice Python by creating a full-stack website.

Let's look at some code to get us started.

Once you've installed Drafter, you only need two lines of code to get started:

.. code-block:: python

    from drafter import *

    start_server()

These two lines of code make an external blank white window appear.
You will generally always need these two lines of code for Drafter to function.
Let's fill in some code in between.

Check out the :ref:`documentation of Components <fulldocs>` to see all that you can
add to your output! What will you put on your website?
