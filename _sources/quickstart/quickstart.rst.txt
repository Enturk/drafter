Websites Quick Start Guide
--------------------------
Websites is an educational interactive graphics Python library. What does that mean?

As a student, you can use Websites to learn and practice Python by creating a full-stack website.

Let's look at some code to get us started.

Once you've installed Websites, you only need two lines of code to get started:

.. code-block:: python

    from websites import *

    start_server()

These two lines of code make an external blank white window appear.
You will generally always need these two lines of code for Websites to function.
Let's fill in some code in between.

Check out the :ref:`documentation of Components <fulldocs>` to see all that you can
add to your output! What will you put on your website?
