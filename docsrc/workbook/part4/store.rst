In this example, we've already written the state and all the routes.
You just need to make all the tests for us!

This is most easily done by just running the site, and then interacting
with the shop. As you explore unique pages, tests will be generated
at the bottom in the "Combined Page History" section at the bottom of the
page. This will only retain unique visits, so you can't just spam the
same page over and over again.

You can also manually create tests by writing them yourself.
Ultimately, though, you need to make at least 10 unique tests.
